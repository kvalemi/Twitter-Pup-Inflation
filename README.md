## Project Description

In this mini project, using the Twitter open API I downloaded all tweets ever from the account @dog_rates. This account posts pictures of dogs and gives each dog a rating out of 10. I was interested to see how the dog rates actually changed over the past five years. So I decided to do some analysis and dig deeper into how dog rates on the internet has changed ever since 2016. 

The analysis can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file. I also summed up my findings in a "blog" style writeup.
